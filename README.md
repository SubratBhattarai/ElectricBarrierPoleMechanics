# electricBarrierPoleMechanics
Created with the help of Arduino. A Basic understanding of an electric Barrier Pole mechanics using light, servo motors, and buzzer. This project was possible with the professor of Robotics of Loras College, Dubuque and my group members. This was a combination of previous projects we have done together.
